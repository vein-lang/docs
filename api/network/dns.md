**Returns:**

- `Job<DomainDetails>`: A job that resolves to a `DomainDetails` object containing the details of the domain.

### Example Usage

```vein
public class Example {
    public async GetDomainDetailsAsync(domain: string): Job<DomainDetails> {
        return await Dns.resolveAsync(domain);
    }
}
```

## Class: `DomainDetails`

The `DomainDetails` class encapsulates the details of a domain returned from a DNS query.

### Example Usage

```vein
public class Example {
    public PrintDomainDetails(details: DomainDetails): void {

        Out.println("IPv4 Address: " + details.ipv4);
    }
}
```

## Summary

The `Dns` class provides a method `resolveAsync` to perform DNS queries asynchronously, returning domain details encapsulated in a `DomainDetails` object. 
The `DomainDetails` class includes properties for the IPv4 address and hostname of the domain.
