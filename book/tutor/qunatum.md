# Quantum Operations <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />  <Badge type="danger" text="Not implemented currently" /> 

In this guide, we will cover the basics of quantum operations in Vein. Vein supports the declaration and execution of quantum operations, which are essential for quantum computing tasks.

At the moment quantum feature of the language is under development, the syntax, runtime part can be changed

## Declaring Quantum Operations

Quantum operations in Vein are declared using the `operation` keyword, and they return a quantum result (`QResult`).

### Syntax

```vein
public operation OperationName(parameters): QResult
```

### Example

```vein
public operation TestOperation(i: i32): QResult {
    // Quantum operation body
}
```

In this example, `TestOperation` is a quantum operation that takes an integer parameter `i` and returns a `QResult`.

## Quantum Commands

Quantum commands are used in special expressions denoted by `Q!{}`. These commands allow you to manipulate qubits and perform quantum operations.

### Syntax

```vein
Q!{
    .qd qubitName[index];
    .cnot controlQubit targetQubit;
    .if (qubit is One) {
        // Conditional quantum operation
    }
    .qcall otherOperation(parameters) |> targetQubit;
    .x(qubit);
}
```

### Example

```vein
public operation QuantumExample(qubits: array<Qubit>): QResult {
    return Q!{
        .qd q[0];
        .qd q[1];
        
        .cnot q[0] q[1];
        .if (q[0] is One) {
            .h(q[0]);
        }
        .qcall AnotherOperation(q[0]) |> q[1];
        .x(q[1]);
    };
}

public operation AnotherOperation(qubit: Qubit): QResult {
    return Q!{
        .h(qubit);
    };
}
```

In this example:
- Qubits are declared and indexed with `.qd`.
- The `CNOT` gate is applied using `.cnot`.
- A conditional quantum operation is performed with `.if`.
- Another operation is called using `.qcall`.
- The `X` gate is applied using `.x`.

## Running Quantum Operations

Quantum operations in Vein are executed using the Microsoft Quantum Simulator. For seamless integration, you need to install the quantum SDK workload.

### Installation

To enable support for quantum operations in Vein, install the quantum SDK workload:

```sh
rune workload install vein.quantum
```

### Running Quantum Operations

Once the workload is installed, you can run quantum operations within your program. The simulator will be invoked transparently to execute the quantum commands.

### Example

```vein
async master(): Job<void> {
    // Example of running a quantum operation
    auto result = qcall TestOperation(5);
    if (result == QResult.Success) {
        Out.println("Quantum operation succeeded.");
    } else {
        Out.println("Quantum operation failed.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `TestOperation` is executed asynchronously, and the result is checked to determine if the quantum operation was successful.

## Conclusion

Understanding quantum operations in Vein allows you to leverage quantum computing capabilities within your applications. By using the `operation` keyword, quantum command expressions (`Q!{}`), and integrating with the Microsoft Quantum Simulator, you can perform complex quantum tasks efficiently.
